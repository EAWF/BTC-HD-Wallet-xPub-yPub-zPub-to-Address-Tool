* Instead of re-creating the wheel, it's probably better to use:
  - [bitcoinjs-lib](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) - A javascript Bitcoin library for node.js and browsers.
  - Kyle Honeycut's [buildl.js](https://github.com/coinables/buidljs) - Buidl.js is a wrapper for the bitcoinjs-lib library.
