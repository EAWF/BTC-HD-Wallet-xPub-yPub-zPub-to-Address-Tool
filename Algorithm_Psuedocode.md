# Algorithm Psuedocode
This should be written in plain, relatively easy to understand english, programming language inspecific, with the exception of standard hashing, base conversion, and string manipulation functions described here:
* SHA-256
* HMAC(SHA512)
* Base58
  - Encode
  - Decode
* RIPEMD160
## Derivation Phases:
   - Obtain raw data contained in the Exported Account-Level Extended Public Key
