# About Algorithm Psuedocode
This should be written in plain, relatively easy to understand english, programming language inspecific, with the exception of standard hashing, base conversion, and string manipulation functions such as described here:
* SHA-256
* HMAC(SHA512)
* Base58
  - Encode
  - Decode
* RIPEMD160
* ECC Math functions will need to be explained specifically where possible, for example, the Generator point and the format used, but can also be generically referred to if it's used in an external ECC Library. We can't re-invent the wheel, but we CAN describe how to use it in generic terms.
